''[[Explanations]]'' //clarify and illuminate// particular topics. They broaden the documentationâ€™s coverage of a topic and provide useful background information and explanation.

Explanations are a chance for the documentation to relax and step back from the software, taking a wider view, illuminating it from a higher level or even from different perspectives. You might imagine an Explanation document being read at leisure, rather than over the code.
